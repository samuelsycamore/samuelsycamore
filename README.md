**I'm Sam Sycamore, a writer and editor with over 10 years of professional experience across multiple industries.**

I help tech startups and digital agencies clearly communicate the value of their products and services to their target users. I especially enjoy writing educational content for tech products, because I believe that strong docs are the best marketing materials you can present to a tech-savvy audience.

I currently work as a Developer Advocate at [MUI](https://mui.com). Previously I served as Marketing Manager at [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com). My specialty as a software engineer is web development with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
